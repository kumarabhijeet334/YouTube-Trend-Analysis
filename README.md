In the digital world, multinational companies depend on online platforms for advertising their products. The most widely visited websites are Google, Youtube and Facebook and past studies have suggested that Youtube advertising poses a huge impact on the users.
Techstacks used - Python, Apache Spark, AWS Lambda, QuickSight, AWS Glue

## Problem Statement

In the digital marketing landscape, multinational corpora- tions face the challenge of effectively allocating advertising re- sources to reach the maximum number of potential customers. With the vast and ever-changing content on YouTube, identi- fying the most impactful videos for advertisement placement remains a significant challenge. Companies need a reliable

method to predict which YouTube videos are likely to trend, ensuring their advertisements are seen by the largest and most relevant audiences.
The current approaches to selecting videos for advertising are often manual, time-consuming, and based on retrospective data, which may not accurately reflect future trends. There is a need for an automated, data-driven solution that can analyze real-time YouTube data, considering various factors such as viewer engagement, likes, shares, comments, and viewer demographics, to predict trending videos.
This project aims to develop a predictive analytics tool that leverages the YouTube API to analyze current video trends and accurately forecast future popular content. This tool would enable multinational corporations to strategically place their advertisements on videos before they trend, maximizing reach and engagement. The solution must be scalable, efficient, and capable of processing the vast amount of data generated by YouTube’s global platform.
The success of this project hinges on its ability to transform the process of advertisement placement from a reactive to a proactive strategy, helping companies stay ahead of the curve in the competitive digital marketing space. This tool will not only enhance the effectiveness of advertising campaigns but also revolutionize the way marketing teams operate, saving time and resources while providing a competitive edge in reaching diverse and extensive online audiences.

## Pipeline
1. Data Ingestion — Build a mechanism to ingest data from different sources
2. ETL System — We are getting data in raw format, transforming this data into the proper format
3. Data lake — We will be getting data from multiple sources so we need centralized repo to store them
4. Scalability — As the size of our data increases, we need to make sure our system scales with it
5. Cloud — We can’t process vast amounts of data on our local computer so we need to use the cloud, in this case, we will use AWS
6. Reporting — Build a dashboard to get answers to the question we asked earlier

## Amazon Services
1. Amazon S3: Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides manufacturing scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
2. AWS IAM: This is nothing but identity and access management which enables us to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
3. QuickSight: Amazon QuickSight is a scalable, serverless, embeddable, machine learning-powered business intelligence (BI) service built for the cloud.
4. AWS Glue: A serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development.
5. AWS Lambda: Lambda is a computing service that allows programmers to run code without creating or managing servers.
6. AWS Athena: Athena is an interactive query service for S3 in which there is no need to load data it stays in S3.
